## About
This package provides an opinionated frontend panel. It's made by DataLinx and used in our Eclipse projects.  
It should be included only in projects that need a frontend.

It shouldn't contain much code, since any important features should be made into separate plugins, which are distributable and generally usable by any developer in Filament-based apps. 

## Download
Download it with composer:
```shell
  composer require eclipsephp/frontend-panel
````
